This is a music page for my music group im in with a friend. 

The Home page is a general overview of the group. You can subsribe on this page as well at the bottom. 
The Music page as music that is linked to spotify. It uses the spotify players to play the music.
The Videos page has music videos we have made over the years. They have controls added to be able to play or stop the video as well as make full screen.

This site uses html, css, bootstrap, and spotify

Ways I would improve the site would be to have more of our music on the site without having to use spotify as the player. 
A logo of the group would be good to add to the navbar. 
A merch page would be added if and when we get merch available. 
Probably a different way of doing the next stop section by adding a link to buying tickets and or the venue itself.
